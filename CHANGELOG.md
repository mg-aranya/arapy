# Changelog

## 1.6.0 - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- project branding now uses `netloom` as the primary name, with `netloom-tool` as the Python package distribution name
- added the `netloom` CLI entrypoint while keeping `arapy` available as a compatibility alias during the transition
- documentation and project metadata now point to `https://netloom.se` and `https://github.com/mathias-granlund/netloom`
- automatic collection paging now respects explicit `--limit` values for `list`, `get --all`, and `copy` instead of overriding them
- the bundled Bash completion script now supports both `netloom` and `arapy`

## 1.5.3 - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- `list`, `get --all`, and `copy` source reads now iterate through paged ClearPass collection responses until all matching entries are fetched instead of stopping after the first page
- `--filter` now applies across the full paged result set, and `--limit` acts as the per-request page size for paged collection reads
- built-in help and README guidance now explain the filtered paging behavior explicitly

## 1.5.2 - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- `arapy copy` now omits blank `radius_secret` and `tacacs_secret` values from generated payloads so hidden source credentials are not replayed as empty strings on target updates or replacements
- `policyelements network-device` copy creates now fail before the API call with a clearer message when the source response does not include usable RADIUS, TACACS+, or SNMP credentials
- copy summaries now print item-level failure reasons directly in terminal output to make validation issues easier to diagnose without debug logging

## 1.5.1 - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- `arapy copy` now uses the normal cached API catalog path for both source and target profiles instead of forcing a fresh `/api-docs` discovery on every run
- added regression coverage to keep the copy workflow aligned with the cache behavior used by the rest of the CLI

## 1.5.0 - 2026-03-13

### Added
- built-in `arapy copy <module> <service> --from=SOURCE --to=TARGET` workflow for copying resources between ClearPass profiles without shell-chaining separate export and import commands
- copy workflow support for `--dry-run`, `--match-by=auto|name|id`, `--on-conflict=fail|skip|update|replace`, and optional report artifacts via `--save-source`, `--save-payload`, and `--save-plan`
- parser, help text, completion, and integration coverage for the new `copy` built-in command

### Changed
- copy execution now fetches source objects, normalizes them against the destination write schema, strips response-only metadata, and reuses destination profile settings within a single command run

## 1.4.11 - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- path override settings such as `ARAPY_OUT_DIR`, `ARAPY_STATE_DIR`, `ARAPY_CACHE_DIR`, and `ARAPY_APP_LOG_DIR` now resolve through the same config/profile loading path as the rest of the runtime settings
- profile-scoped path overrides such as `ARAPY_OUT_DIR_PROD` are now respected
- `~` is now expanded in configured path overrides so values like `ARAPY_OUT_DIR=~/responses` resolve to the user home directory as expected

## 1.4.10 - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- saved ClearPass `list` responses can now be reused as `--file` input for write actions by unwrapping `_embedded.items` and dropping response `_links`
- file-backed `add`, `update`, and `replace` requests now filter response-only fields such as `id` out of the JSON body while still allowing path fields to resolve update/replace URLs
- empty optional container values from exported responses, such as `attributes: {}`, are now omitted from replayed write payloads when ClearPass expects the field to be absent instead of empty
- `--decrypt` now also disables secret masking in HTTP request debug logs so troubleshooting output matches the requested secret visibility
- client construction remains compatible with older test doubles and call sites that do not accept the new secret-masking parameter

## 1.4.9 - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- `/api-docs` help notes now strip embedded HTML more cleanly instead of dumping raw tags into `--help` output
- list-action help notes now preserve multiline structure for filter documentation and similar table-style notes

## 1.4.8 - 2026-03-12

### Added
- `arapy server list`, `arapy server show`, and `arapy server use <profile>` built-in commands for switching between named ClearPass environments
- profile-aware configuration loading from `~/.config/arapy/profiles.env` and `~/.config/arapy/credentials.env`
- packaged `profiles.env.example` and `credentials.env.example` templates for per-user profile setup

### Changed
- environment loading now resolves profile-scoped keys such as `ARAPY_SERVER_PROD` and `ARAPY_CLIENT_SECRET_DEV` based on `ARAPY_ACTIVE_PROFILE`
- shell completion and built-in help now include the `server` command surface and discovered profile names
- README now documents the profile-based configuration model and the replacement example files

## 1.4.7 - 2026-03-11

### Added
- `arapy-install-manpage` helper command to install the bundled `arapy(1)` page into a local `man1` directory after package installation
- packaged copy of the man page under `arapy/data/man/arapy.1` so the helper works from installed wheels and editable installs
- package metadata for classifiers, project URLs, and explicit license handling
- `LICENSE` file and `MANIFEST.in` for cleaner source and binary distributions
- GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and validate built distributions
- `build` and `twine` in the `.[dev]` extra for local release validation

### Changed
- README now documents the helper-based `man arapy` setup path
- README now documents local build and package validation commands

## 1.4.6 - 2026-03-11

### Added
- static `arapy(1)` man page at `man/arapy.1` for users who prefer standard Unix CLI documentation

### Changed
- README now points to the bundled man page and shows how to view it locally with `man -l`

## 1.4.5 - 2026-03-11

### Added
- property-based fuzz coverage with `hypothesis` for CLI parsing, recursive secret masking, and `calculate_count` query serialization

### Changed
- `hypothesis` is now included in the `.[dev]` extra
- local `.hypothesis/` state is ignored by git

## 1.4.4 - 2026-03-11

### Changed
- `--help` output now suppresses redundant `params:` sections for actions that already expose richer `body fields:` metadata
- query/path-oriented actions such as `list` and `get` still show `params:` when no body metadata is available

## 1.4.3 - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- raw byte output now treats control-heavy byte streams as binary for console display instead of echoing unreadable control characters
- `calculate_count` query values are now serialized as lowercase `true` / `false` strings for ClearPass compatibility
- Swagger GET routes with unresolved placeholder-style base paths are no longer overclassified as `list` actions
- list endpoint smoke coverage now uses safer default query parameters and skips placeholder-dependent list routes

## 1.4.2 - 2026-03-11

### Added
- richer dynamic help metadata from ClearPass docs, including summaries, response codes, response content types, body field lists, and generated body examples when the API docs expose models
- direct token authentication via `ARAPY_API_TOKEN` / `--api-token=...`
- token-file authentication via `ARAPY_API_TOKEN_FILE` / `--token-file=...`
- binary response awareness for dynamically discovered download/export endpoints, including raw output auto-selection and filename inference from response headers

### Changed
- `list` is once again exposed in completion/help output alongside `get`
- raw output now writes binary payloads as bytes instead of forcing text decoding
- API catalog cache format bumped to v3 while keeping v2 cache loading compatibility

## 1.4.1 - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- removed transitional top-level compatibility wrapper modules
- moved command handlers into `arapy.cli.commands` so the package layout is now fully aligned with the `cli/core/io/logging` split
- cleaned the source release to exclude `.git`, `.env`, cache directories, Python bytecode, and `*.egg-info` artifacts
- updated tests and documentation to target only the v1.4.x module layout

## 1.4.0 - 2026-03-09

### Added
- environment-driven settings loader with XDG-style cache/state/output directories
- new package structure under `cli`, `core`, `io`, and `logging`
- `.env.example` for local configuration
- Ruff linting and formatting baseline in `pyproject.toml`

### Changed
- entrypoint now lives in `arapy.cli.main`
- help rendering moved to `arapy.cli.help`
- completion logic moved to `arapy.cli.completion`
- resolver and request/payload building moved into `arapy.core.resolver`
- response output and file loading split into `arapy.io.output` and `arapy.io.files`
- logger setup is deterministic and no longer depends on singleton initialization order
- cache and response output defaults moved out of the repository tree
- tests now target the action-aware v1.3.1+ API catalog structure

### Removed
- hardcoded ClearPass server and credential values from source control
- in-tree cache/log directory assumptions as the default runtime behavior

## 1.3.1

- action-aware API catalog cache
- parameterized Swagger endpoints preserved in cache
- normalized single `*_id` placeholders to `{id}`
- dynamic help and `list` alias for `get --all`
- configurable secret masking in output
